# Python-for-GCP-Interact-with-Google-Cloud-Using-Python
Python For GCP is a project aimed at simplifying the interaction with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services using Python. This repository provides code examples and scripts that help you manage and automate various GCP resources such as BigQuery, Cloud Storage, BigTable, Compute Engine, and more entirely through Python.

# Feautures

1. GCP Infrastructure Management with Python
   
Manage and provision GCP infrastructure components such as Virtual Machines (VMs), disks, and machine images using Python scripts. This enables Infrastructure as Code (IaC) workflows where you can automate environment setup, scale resources, and manage your infrastructure lifecycle without using the console or manual configuration.

Key capabilities:

Create and delete Compute Engine instances (VMs)

Attach or detach persistent disks to VMs

Create machine images from running instances

Restart VMs programmatically across a project or zone


2. BigQuery Integration
   
Perform BigQuery operations using Python, such as loading datasets, querying tables, and exporting results. This is ideal for automating data pipelines, analytics, and reporting processes.

Key capabilities:

Load data into BigQuery tables from CSV/JSON files or Cloud Storage

Run SQL queries and retrieve results as Pandas DataFrames

Export data from BigQuery to Google Cloud Storage

Manage datasets and tables programmatically


3. BigTable Integration
   
Ingest and retrieve time-series or NoSQL-style data using BigTable with Python. This is particularly useful for high-throughput, low-latency workloads.

Key capabilities:

Connect to Cloud BigTable instances and tables

Insert bulk rows and column families using Python clients

Read or scan data with filtering capabilities


4. VM Automation
   
Automate routine VM operations across projects or instances using Python. This is valuable for saving costs, maintaining environments, or scheduling tasks.

Key capabilities:

Restart all VMs in a project or specific zone

Stop or delete VMs programmatically

List or manage VMs and their metadata


5. Cloud Storage (GCS) Operations
   
Interact with Google Cloud Storage buckets and objects using Python, useful for handling unstructured data like media files, logs, backups, or datasets.

Key capabilities:

Create and delete GCS buckets

Upload and download objects/files

List objects within a bucket

Manage access permissions and object metadata

6. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Jobs
   
Use Python to perform sensitive data inspections across datasets or storage using Google Cloud DLP. This helps ensure compliance and data privacy.

Key capabilities:

Set up and execute DLP inspection jobs via API

Scan for sensitive information like PII, PHI, or financial data

Automate reports or trigger alerts based on findings
